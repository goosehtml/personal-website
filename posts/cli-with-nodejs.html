        <h3 class="content-subheading">What's a CLI?</h3>
        <p class="content-text">
          A CLI (command line interface) is a program that accepts text input to execute a certain command.  Back when
          old computers terminals were still around, using a CLI was the only way to access and control a machine.  Nowadays, almost everything
          is a GUI.  A regular user isn't gonna' use <code class="inline-code">mkdir</code> to create a new folder when they can just
          right-click and hit "New Folder", but if you're reading this article, you're not a regular user — you're probably a software
          developer or system administrator.  If that's the case, a CLI is your second home.
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
          For a developer or sysadmin, CLIs are used for various things: installing software, configuring, accessing network settings, etc.
          Additionally, they're just fun to use, which is why I decided to build my own CLI application using Node.js.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3 class="content-subheading">Prerequisites</h3>
        <p class="content-text">
          Believe it or not, building a CLI application is pretty simple; in this tutorial, I'll show you
          exactly how you can build your own.  Before starting, there's a few things you'll need:
          <ul class="content-list">
            <li class="content-list"><a class="content-link" href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> - Node.js is a server-side
            runtime environment that lets you run JavaScript outside a web browser.</li>
            <li><a class="content-link" href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm">npm</a> - By default,
            npm comes pre-installed with Node.js.  If you already have Node.js, chances are, you also have npm.  To check if npm is
            installed on your machine, type <code class="inline-code">npm -v</code> into the command line.</li>
            <li>Terminal emulator - A CLI runs on a terminal emulator, so this prerequisite is pretty obvious.  There's many different
            terminal emulators to choose from, but since this project will be built inside VS Code, you can use it's built-in Terminal.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
            ...once you have everything, initialize a new directory on your machine with the name of your project and open it on VS Code.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3 class="content-subheading">Creating an npm package</h3>
        <p class="content-text">
          In order to create a CLI application, there's a few dependencies you need.  After making your application, I'll also teach you how
          to deploy your CLI as an npm package.  To do that, you first need to set up a new package:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-shell">
$ npm init
        </code></pre>
        <p class="content-text">
          ...this will ask you a few questions about your project before initializing a new package.  Once that's complete, you should have a <code class="inline-code">package.json</code>
          file.  By default, dependencies are imported using the CommonJS syntax (<code class="inline-code">require</code>).  For this project, I want to import the
          dependencies with the ES6 Modules syntax (<code class="inline-code">import</code>).  To change this, open the <code class="inline-code">package.json</code>
          file and set a <code class="inline-code">type</code>...
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-json">
// ...            
"type": "module",
// ...
        </code></pre>
        <p class="content-text">
          ...next, add an npm script to run the program.  The <code class="inline-code">.js</code> filename will be whatever file holds your application.
          In my case, the CLI will live inside a file called <code class="inline-code">devtools.js</code>...
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-json">
// ...            
"scripts": {
    "start": "node devtools.js"
  },
// ...
        </code></pre>
        <p class="content-text">
          ...finally, add a key/value pair for <code class="inline-code">bin</code>.  Anything listed in the <code class="inline-code">bin</code>
          section of the <code class="inline-code">package.json</code> file will be made available as a command...
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-json">
// ...            
"bin": {
    "devtools": "./devtools.js"
  },
// ...
        </code></pre>
        <p class="content-text">
          ...this will allow me to run the CLI application by simply typing <code class="inline-code">devtools</code> into the command line.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3 class="content-subheading">Installing the dependencies</h3>
        <p class="content-text">
          Now that everything is set up, you can install the dependencies via npm.  Typically, a CLI application accepts user input.  In order to make
          this possible, you'll need to install the <a class="content-link" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer">inquirer.js</a> package.  For a
          bare-bones CLI, inquirer alone should suffice, but since I want my CLI application to have visual flair, I'll be installing additional dependencies.
          These dependencies will add things like ASCII art, animations, and colorful text.  To install everything, type this into the command line:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-shell">
$ npm install inquirer chalk chalk-animation figlet
        </code></pre>
        <p class="content-text">
          ...you can check the <code class="inline-code">package.json</code> file to make sure everything was installed.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3 class="content-subheading">Setting up your JavaScript file</h3>
        <p class="content-text">
          Now that you've set up an npm package and installed all the necessary dependencies, you can finally start creating your CLI.  In your project
          directory, create a <code class="inline-code">.js</code> file with a filename that matches the one you chose as a path in your
          <code class="inline-code">package.json</code> file.  In my case, the file will be named <code class="inline-code">devtools.js</code>.
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
          Inside the file, type this on the very first line:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
#!/usr/bin/env node
        </code></pre>
        <p class="content-text">
          ...this is called a "shebang", and it should always be included when writing a command line script; it basically tells the OS to execute the code with
          Node.js.  Next, import all the dependencies...
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
import chalk from "chalk";
import inquirer from "inquirer";
import figlet from "figlet";
import chalkAnimation from "chalk-animation";
        </code></pre>
        <p class="content-text">
          ...now, all the installed dependencies are ready to use.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3 class="content-subheading">Creating a prompt with inquirer.js</h3>
        <p class="content-text">
          In order to process user input, you need to launch the prompt interface by using the <code class="inline-code">.prompt()</code> method,
          which takes in two parameters: questions (as an array), and answers (as an object).  As an example, take a look at the CLI menu I made for
          my DevTools application:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
async function devToolsMenu() {
  console.clear();
  const answers = await inquirer.prompt({
    name: "chosenTool",
    type: "list",
    message: "WELCOME TO DEVTOOLS!  SELECT A TOOL TO USE:",
    choices: [
      "Random Color Generator",
      "Decimal-to-Binary Converter",
      "Countdown Timer",
      "Digital Clock",
    ],
  });

  let chosenOption = answers.chosenTool;
  switch (chosenOption) {
    case "Random Color Generator":
      runRandomColorGenerator();
      break;
    case "Decimal-to-Binary Converter":
      runDecimalToBinaryConverter();
      break;
    case "Countdown Timer":
      runCountdownTimer();
      break;
    case "Digital Clock":
      runDigitalClock();
      break;
  }
}
        </code></pre>
        <p class="content-text">
          ...everything is inside the asynchronous function <code class="inline-code">devToolsMenu</code>, which I can call at any time to display
          the prompt.  The <code class="inline-code">answers</code> object contains question-related values, such as the type of prompt, the question to print,
          and the choices.  These can be found on the <a class="content-link" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer">documentation</a> page for inquirer.js.
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
          In simple terms, the code snippet above translates to: "Create a list prompt that gives the user four tools
          to choose from.  Whatever tool they choose, store that decision inside a variable called <code class="inline-code">chosenOption</code>,
          and create a <code class="inline-code">switch</code> statement with that variable in order to determine which tool to launch."
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
          If the <code class="inline-code">devToolsMenu</code> function is invoked and I run <code class="inline-code">devtools</code> in the Terminal, the CLI
          application should look something like this:
        </p>
        <img class="content-image" src="./images/prompt.jpg" alt="screenshot of terminal cli prompt">
        <p class="content-text">
          ...pretty cool, huh?
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3 class="content-subheading">Using figlet.js and chalk.js</h3>
        <p class="content-text">
          As stated earlier, creating a CLI with only inquirer.js is totally possibly, but you'll probably end up with a plain and boring application.  To fix this, I'll
          show you how to style your application with the other installed dependencies.  As an example, I'll use the function for my countdown timer tool:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
async function runCountdownTimer() {
  console.clear();
  const answers = await inquirer.prompt({
    name: "timerDuration",
    type: "number",
    message: "Set a countdown timer for how many seconds?",
    validate: (answer) => {
      if (isNaN(answer)) {
        return `Invalid number.  Press ${chalk
          .rgb(255, 255, 255)
          .bold("control + K")} and try again.`;
      }
      return true;
    },
  });

  let seconds = answers.timerDuration;
  console.clear();
  console.log(seconds);

  let timer = setInterval(() => {
    console.clear();
    seconds--;
    console.log(seconds);

    if (seconds == 0) {
      console.clear();
      clearInterval(timer);
      figlet("TIME!", function (err, data) {
        if (err) {
          console.log("Could not load 'TIME!' ASCII art...");
        }
        console.log(chalk.redBright.bold(data));
      });
    }
  }, 1000);
}
        </code></pre>
        <p class="content-text">
          ...here, I've created another prompt, except this one has a <code class="inline-code">type</code> of <code class="inline-code">number</code>,
          which lets the user input a number.  inquirer.js also eases the process of validating data with it's <code class="inline-code">validate</code>
          property, which takes a function as a value.  Inside that function, the application checks whether the user input was a number or not. If it was,
          it'll return as true and start the countdown timer; otherwise, it'll return as false and display an error message.
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
          By taking a closer look at my function, you can see the use of the figlet.js and chalk.js dependencies.  figlet.js allows you to turn
          regular text into ASCII art, whereas chalk.js gives your text color.  Here's how I implemented both dependencies into my countdown timer tool:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
figlet("TIME!", function (err, data) {
  if (err) {
    console.log("Could not load 'TIME!' ASCII art...");
  }
  console.log(chalk.redBright.bold(data));
});

        </code></pre>
        <p class="content-text">
          ...calling the <code class="inline-code">figlet</code> object as a function takes three parameters: the input text, options, and a callback function.
          Here, I've omitted the options parameter, using only the input text and callback function.  Once the countdown timer reaches 0,
          <code class="inline-code">TIME!</code> will be displayed in the Terminal in the form of ASCII art.  To style it even further, I combined figlet.js
          with chalk.js to make the text bright-red...
        </p>
        <img class="content-image" src="./images/time-ascii.jpg" alt="screenshot of ascii art">
        <p class="content-text">
          ...now that's flashy, but I think I can make the application look even better!
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3 class="content-subheading">chalk-animation.js — the icing on top</h3>
        <p class="content-text">
          To finalize my CLI application, I decided to add a loading screen whenever the application launches.  Achieving this was simple through the
          implementation of a <code class="inline-code">setTimeout</code> function that invokes the menu function after 2 seconds:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
figlet("DEVTOOLS", function (err, data) {
  console.clear();
  if (err) {
    console.log("Could not load 'DEVTOOLS' ASCII art...");
  }

  const loadingMenuScreen = chalkAnimation.rainbow(data);
  loadingMenuScreen.start();

  setTimeout(() => {
    loadingMenuScreen.stop();
    devToolsMenu();
  }, 2000);
});
        </code></pre>
        <p class="content-text">
          ...I wanted the loading screen to display the application name as ASCII art by using figlet.js again.  To improve the loading screen even further,
          I decided to use the chalk-animation.js dependency, which animates text.  It comes with a few different animations, but my favorite was the
          <code class="inline-code">rainbow</code> effect...
        </p>
        <img class="content-image" src="./images/animation.gif" alt="gif of animated loading screen">
        <p class="content-text">
          ...needless to say, I was quite satisfied!
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3 class="content-subheading">Using your CLI from anywhere</h3>
        <p class="content-text">
          By default, your application will only run in the project directory.  In order to execute your CLI from anywhere in the terminal emulator,
          type this into the command line:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-shell">
$ sudo npm link
        </code></pre>
        <p class="content-text">
          ...this will ask for your password since it's a root user command.  Now, your CLI can be executed from anywhere by using the command you
          set inside <code class="inline-code">bin</code>.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3 class="content-subheading">Publishing your package to npm</h3>
        <p class="content-text">
          Now that your application is complete, you can publish it to npm for the world to use.  In order to do this, you first need to create an
          npm account, which you can do <a class="content-link" href="https://www.npmjs.com/signup">here</a>.  Once you've made an account, go back
          to your project and type this into the command line:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-shell">
$ npm login
        </code></pre>
        <p class="content-text">
          ...this will prompt you to enter your username, password, and email.  Make sure you've confirmed your email address and set up 2FA before
          attempting to publish a package, otherwise, you might run into issues.  The name of your npm package will match that of the
          <code class="inline-code">name</code> value in <code class="inline-code">package.json</code>.  If a package with that name already exists
          on npm, you'll have to rename it.  Finally, publish the package...
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-shell">
$ npm publish
        </code></pre>
        <p class="content-text">
          ...all done!  Your CLI application should now be available as a package on the npm registry!
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
          If you're interested in checking out my DevTools application, you can find it
          <a class="content-link" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/devtools-rgui">here</a> as an npm package.  Alternatively, you can also
          grab a copy of it from the <a class="content-link" href="https://github.com/renderGUI/dev-tools">Github repository</a>!
