        <h3 class="content-subheading">Why are module bundlers necessary?</h3>
        <p class="content-text">
          Years ago, building a website typically only required HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.  As technology advanced,
          so did the complexity of websites.  Nowadays, modern web applications use additional technologies like
          CSS preprocessors, frameworks, and third-party modules.  These technologies make web development easier but
          also present a lot of new problems.
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
          The size of modern web applications can get pretty big, which means load times and performance can drastically slow down.
          Additionally, everybody uses different web browsers, so you also need to make sure your web application is compatible
          across multiple browsers, which can be a nightmare.
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
            To top it off, creating modern web applications usually means you'll be using modules.  npm is the
            default package manager for node.js, the server-side runtime environment.  Since JavaScript is
            client-side, this makes loading modules tricky; a lot of dependencies use the CommonJS syntax, which doesn't 
            work with the modern ES6 syntax.  If you try importing an npm module into a client-side JavaScript application,
            you'll probably get an error like this in the console:
        </p>
        <img class="content-image" src="./images/module-error.png" alt="screenshot of console error">
        <p class="content-text">
          ...luckily, module bundlers fix all these issues.
        </p>

        <h3 class="content-subheading">How do module bundlers work?</h3>
        <p class="content-text">
          A module bundler is a tool that gets around these problems by implementing a "build" step, which bundles all your
          files into one, browser-compatible JavaScript file.  There's several module bundlers on the Internet, but the most popular is
          webpack.  In this guide, I'll show you how to install and configure webpack so you can use modules on
          the client-side.
        </p>

        <h3 class="content-subheading">Installing webpack</h3>
        <p class="content-text">
          webpack can easily be installed as a dependency through npm.  Before installing webpack, create a new project in VS Code.  By default,
          webpack will assume the entry point of your project is <code class="inline-code">src/index.js</code>, so create a folder with that file
          and then open the Terminal; install webpack by typing this into the command line:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-shell">
$ npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
        </code></pre>
        <p class="content-text">
          ...webpack is installed as a development dependency because it's not necessary for the final production build.
          Next, check the <code class="inline-code">package.json</code> file to make sure everything installed successfully...
        </p>
        <img class="content-image" src="./images/webpack-install.png" alt="screenshot package.json file">
        <p class="content-text">
          ...after this, use a task runner by creating an npm script in the <code class="inline-code">package.json</code>
          file...
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-json">
// ...
"scripts": {
    "build": "webpack"
},
// ...
        </code></pre>
        <p class="content-text">
          ...this script will execute the webpack command whenever you type <code class="inline-code">npm run build</code> into the
          command line.  webpack will then analyze the code inside the <code class="inline-code">index.js</code> file and compile it.  By default,
          webpack will output the result in <code class="inline-code">dist/main.js</code>.  Now, instead of having
          <code class="inline-code">index.js</code> as the main path in the <code class="inline-code">script</code> tag of your HTML file, change
          it to <code class="inline-code">../dist/main.js</code>.  Finally, run the build command.
        </p>

        <p class="content-text">
          Congratulations, you just bundled your first module!  Now you can use npm packages on the client-side without worrying about
          getting any errors.  To test this out, I'll use the <code class="inline-code">moment.js</code> package as an example.  moment.js
          is a simple library for formatting dates in a more readable manner.  I installed this module by running
          <code class="inline-code">npm install moment</code> in the command line.  Next, I'll import the library into my
          <code class="inline-code">index.js</code> file using the CommonJS syntax, like so:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
// index.js          
const moment = require("moment");
        </code></pre>
        <p class="content-text">
          ...after importing the library, I can use one of the included methods.  The method I'm using returns the amount of
          hours it's been since the day started...
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
// index.js
console.log(moment().startOf("day").fromNow());
        </code></pre>
        <p class="content-text">
          ...now, if I open my browser and check Chrome DevTools, I can see the module works without throwing any errors...
        </p>
        <img class="content-image" src="./images/module-working.png" alt="screenshot of module working in browser">
        <p class="content-text">
          ...easy!  With webpack set up, you can use
          just about any npm module on the client-side.
        </p>

        <h3 class="content-subheading">Advanced webpack configuration</h3>
        <p class="content-text">
          The great thing about webpack is that it isn't just limited to getting rid of those annoying "<code class="inline-code">require</code>
          is not defined" messages.  webpack also allows you to generate source maps, as well as use plugins and loaders, which can be used
          for preprocessing assets or CSS files.  webpack can read these options from a configuration file named
          <code class="inline-code">webpack.config.js</code>, which you create in the root directory of your project.  To learn more
          about manually configuring webpack, you can visit the
          <a class="content-link" href="https://webpack.js.org/configuration/">official webpack documentation</a>.
